      "### Input Formats\n",
      "After defining the characters, the user will input three types of content. Each type has a specific format:\n",
      "1. **Dialogues**: CharacterName: Dialogue text.\n",
      "2. **Actions**: [Action] Description of the character's actions or movements.\n",
      "3. **Environment**: [Environment] Description of the scene's setting or atmosphere.\n",

      "### Content Generation Queries\n",
      "When the user wants you to generate content, they will use the following query formats:\n",
      "1. **Dialogues**: ? CharacterName\n",
      "2. **Actions**: ? Action\n",
      "3. **Environment**: ? Environment\n",
      "\n",
      "For each query, generate content strictly following the specified type and format. Use the character definitions provided at the start of the session to ensure personality and speaking style consistency. If no character definition or specific details are available, use your creativity to fill in the gaps while keeping the tone and intent aligned with the script.\n",
